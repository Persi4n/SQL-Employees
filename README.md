# Employee Database Management Project

This project involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks using an employee database. The project is based on six CSV files provided, namely:

- `Departments.csv`
- `dept_emp.csv`
- `dept_manager.csv`
- `employees.csv`
- `salaries.csv`
- `titles.csv`

The goal of this project is to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), design table schemas, import data from CSV files, and perform various data analysis tasks using SQL queries.

## Table Schemas

Here are the table schemas designed for this project:

- `Departments`
- `Employees`
- `Dept_Emp`
- `Dept_Manager`
- `Salaries`
- `Titles`

## Data Analysis

The project includes several data analysis tasks, each accomplished using SQL queries. Here are some examples:

1. List employee details with their employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. List employees hired in 1986.
3. List department managers with department details.
4. List employees with their department numbers and names.
5. List employees with specific first name and last name.
6. List employees in the Sales department.
7. List employees in the Sales and Development departments.
8. List frequency counts of employee last names.

Each task involves running specific SQL queries against the database.

## Usage

1. **ERD**: You can use a tool like [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to create an ERD based on the relationships described in this README.

2. **Table Creation**: Execute the SQL schema provided in the schema file to create the necessary tables in your database system.

3. **Data Import**: Import the provided CSV files into the respective tables using SQL or a database management tool.

4. **Data Analysis**: Execute the SQL queries provided in this README to perform various data analysis tasks on the database.
